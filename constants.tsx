export const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "Why does my valve keep spinning without closing?",
    answer: "That's a classic Alexandria gate valve failure. The internal stem has likely snapped or the threads are too mineral-caked to engage. It's essentially a paperweight at this point."

  {
    question: "Do you handle the permit for the street shutoff?",
    answer: "We handle all the coordination with Alexandria Renew or Virginia American Water if we need to pull a meter or access city-side lines."

    question: "Is my old lead pipe a problem for a valve swap?",
    answer: "It's common here. We use specialized transition couplings to ensure a watertight seal between old lead or galvanized lines and modern brass valves."
